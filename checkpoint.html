<h1>Project 1 Checkpoint</h1>
<p>Please indicate your team members and the task assignment for each member:</p>

David - HTML and CSS for the pages and selecting/encoding the included puzzles<br>
Zach - Class design and PHP coding of the model and its tests<br>
Jalal - Design and coding of the view(s) and controller(s) and their tests<br>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>List all of the classes you expect your project to require and a brief desciption of the purpose of the class:</p>

<p>Games: holds the ten different games that will be selected at random</p>

<p>SudokuGame: the main class for the sudoku game<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;Array of Arrays (matrix 9x9) that contain Cells<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;IsSolved(): bool</p>

<p>SudokuCell: holds the information for each cell<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;knows: bool<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;Correct answer: num<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;Show answers: bool<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;User Guess: num<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;Notes: array of nums</p>

<p>SudokuController: handles user interaction for when they put a number in a cell, selecting cheat mode, or giving up</p>

<p>SudokuModel: what is displayed on the sudoku game</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Indicate how you will encode a sample puzzle as PHP. Remember, that you need to encode not only how the puzzle will appear to the user, but the solution as well.</p>

We will incode a puzzle as an Array of Arrays that store Cell classes. Each cell class will know both the solution and whether to show that cell's number at the start of the puzzle.
